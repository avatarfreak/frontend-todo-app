## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [windicss](https://windicss.org/) - For styles

### What I learned

Todo app is simple. I got a chance to use windicss as new technology stack for styling. Drag and Drop web api is used along with custom hook. Other technology used is typescript.

### Continued development

I planning to focus more on JAM Stack technology.

### Useful resources

- [styling](https://windicss.org/) - This helped me for styling web page.
